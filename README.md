Classifies defects in STEM images. Made as part of the Machine Learning and Microscopy Hackathon hosted at the University of Tennesse.

classifyImage.ipynb uses the pretrained models to classify defects in a provided STEM image.
monoFeatureDetecterTrainer.ipynb was used to train the models.
preprocPipelineDemo.ipynb contains an example of the preprocessing pipeline used.
